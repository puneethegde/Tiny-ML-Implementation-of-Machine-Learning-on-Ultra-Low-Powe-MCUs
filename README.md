TinyML is a field of machine learning that focuses on developing and deploying machine learning models on resource-constrained devices, such as microcontrollers and single-board computers.
TinyML allows us to run machine learning models directly on these devices, enabling a wide range of applications such as wearable devices, Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and edge computing systems.
By running models locally, TinyML eliminates the need to send data to the cloud for processing, reducing latency and improving privacy.
TinyML requires models to be small and efficient, so that they can be run on devices with limited memory and computational resources. This typically involves using lightweight models, such as decision trees, logistic regression, and converting them to a format that can be executed efficiently on the target device, such as TensorFlow Lite, FOMO, YOLO, MobileNets, Arm NN etc.

## Implementation:

Load the given code in Arduino IDE, If you are using ESP32 CAM setup the basic setups (https://lastminuteengineers.com/getting-started-with-esp32-cam/) then select the port and dump the code.Before dumping please make sure you have changed the wifi name and password in the code and connect your laptop to same network. While dumping put the jumper cable then after dumping the code take out the jumper and press reset button. Then paste the IP address in your browser. You can change the look and feel of the page using HTML if you want. You can see the people or object counting in the serial monitor.


## Results:


## Object detection:
